# Footer rename

- **Goal:** Rename the lower layout zone from Hint to Footer and propagate the terminology throughout the related documentation without touching runtime code.
- **Work:** rewrote `ctx/composition/client/ui/layout/skeleton.md`, `overview.md`, and `call.md` to introduce the Footer zone, updated `overlays/share-link.md` to align the overlay narrative, and rephrased `ctx/composition/client/states/states.md` plus the Home/Invite/Settings screen descriptions so they reference Footer wherever the lower zone appears.
- **Testing:** not run (documentation-only changes).
